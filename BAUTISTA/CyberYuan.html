    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>A successful cybersecurity approach has multiple layers of protection spread across the computers, networks, programs, or data that one intends to keep safe. In an organization, the people, processes, and technology must all complement one another to create an effective defense from cyber attacks. A unified threat management system can automate integrations across select Cisco Security products and accelerate key security operations functions: detection, investigation, and remediation.</p>

      <h4>The process of keeping up with new technologies, security trends and threat intelligence is a challenging task. It is necessary in order to protect information and other assets from cyberthreats, which take many forms. Types of cyberthreats include:</h4>
    </div>
    <ul class="w3-ul w3-hoverable w3-white">
      <li class="w3-padding-16">
        <span class="w3-large">MALWARE</span><br>
        <span> is a form of malicious software in which any file or program can be used to harm a computer user. This includes worms, viruses, Trojans and spyware.</span>
      </li>
      <li class="w3-padding-16">
        <span class="w3-large">RANSOMWARE</span><br>
        <span>is another type of malware. It involves an attacker locking the victim's computer system files -- typically through encryption -- and demanding a payment to decrypt and unlock them.</span>
      </li> 
      <li class="w3-padding-16">
        <span class="w3-large">SOCIAL ENGINEERING</span><br>
        <span>is an attack that relies on human interaction to trick users into breaking security procedures to gain sensitive information that is typically protected.</span>
      </li>   
      <li class="w3-padding-16 w3-hide-medium w3-hide-small">
        <span class="w3-large">SPEAR PHISHING</span><br>
        <span> is a type of phishing attack that has an intended target user, organization or business.</span>
      </li> 
       <li class="w3-padding-16">
         <span class="w3-large">INSIDER THREATS</span><br>
        <span>are security breaches or losses caused by humans -- for example, employees, contractors or customers. Insider threats can be malicious or negligent in nature.</span>
      </li> 
       <li class="w3-padding-16">
         <span class="w3-large">DISTRIBUTED DENIAL-OF-SERVICE ATTACKS</span><br>
        <span>are those in which multiple systems disrupt the traffic of a targeted system, such as a server, website or other network resource. By flooding the target with messages, connection requests or packets, the attackers can slow the system or crash it, preventing legitimate traffic from using it.</span>
